# Flight Price Prediction

The objective of the project is to create a tool that estimates flight prices to help users look for the best prices when booking flight tickets. This system will give people an idea about the trends that prices follow and also provide a predicted price value which they can refer to before booking their flight tickets to save money. This kind of system or service can be provided to the customers by flight booking companies which will help the customers to book their tickets accordingly. Built a client-facing API using the Flask framework. Visit the web app: https://flight-price-prediction-1.onrender.com
